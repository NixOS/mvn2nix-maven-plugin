mvn2nix
========

Generate `project-info.json` for use with nix's Maven repository generation
functions.

Note: This is slower than anyone would like and not expected to be perfect.
Please open issues if something isn't working for you!

Appears to require maven 3.2.5 to build locally.

Usage
------

```bash
nix run -f https://github.com/NixOS/mvn2nix-maven-plugin/archive/master.tar.gz \
    --command mvn2nix > project-info.json
```

> The _json_ dependency information will by default write to STDOUT.

System properties
------------------

* `outputFile`: Set the name of the file generated by mvn2nix, otherwise it is output to STDOUT
